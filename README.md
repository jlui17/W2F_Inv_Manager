# My Personal CPSC 210 Project

## An Inventory Management System

The **Inventory Management System** is a program that will allow the user(s) to record stock for the 
games section of the *Richmond Night Market*. 

The user will be able to: 
- record stock bag information
- view a map of the storage containers 
- view logistical information regarding stock specfically for each game 

This program will mainly be used by myself, as I am working as the *Inventory Manager* for the *Richmond
Night Markets games section*. This project is interesting to me because there is no current tracking 
system in place, so this program will allow me to track all of our inventory and easily locate stock
that is needed on an operations night.
